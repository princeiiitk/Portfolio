      "Description": "Bank Management System (MERN Stack)I am currently developing a Bank Management System using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), building on a similar project I created in C++. This application enables users to manage their bank accounts online, with core functionalities such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, transaction history, and balance inquiries. It features secure data management on the backend with Express and Node.js, while a React frontend provides a responsive and intuitive user experience. The project emphasizes modular design and secure data handling to simulate a reliable and efficient banking environment."
